## Lab 1
[Programming Assignment 1: Running Times for Maximum Subsequence Sum](http://www.csulb.edu/~tebert/teaching/spring18/328/lab/mss/mss.pdf)  
A GUI with a selection box.

## Lab 2

[Programming Assignment 2: Classifying Text Data](http://www.csulb.edu/~tebert/teaching/spring18/328/lab/classify/classify.pdf)   
A GUI with Tabs for each option. HashTables are implemented with generics specialized for objects which is composed of a key and any other attributes. 

## Lab 3
[Programming Assignment 3: Parse Trees](http://www.csulb.edu/~tebert/teaching/spring18/328/lab/parse_tree/parse_tree.pdf)  
A simple text box. An equation is entered and upon pressing `ENTER` a new window is opened with the given equation displayed as a Tree. Nodes are able to be dragged with the outer border. Accepts integers, operators (+, -, *, /, ^), and any single character variables.  
Upon clicking a variable, the user is prompted to input a value for that variable.
